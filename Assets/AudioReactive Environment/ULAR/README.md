# ULAR: Unity Live Audio Reactor

This Project aims to provide a easy way to make any object in Unity react to audio. 
No matter if the audio originates from Unity itself or the PC audio (Websites, Games, etc.)

ULAR is a result of some tutorials regarding Unity audio access and me. Who put everything together, over many months to provide a simple tool.

The tutorials were provided by PeerPlay:    https://www.youtube.com/c/PeerPlay \
